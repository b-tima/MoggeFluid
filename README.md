# MoggeFluid

This is a fluid simulation based on the video by Sebastian Lague

It is implemented in C using SDL (and maths...)

## Building

You can run the following command on arch (assuming you have ```paru``` installed...) to install the dependencies:

```
paru -S gcc openmd sdl2
```

then simply run ```make``` in the root. The executable will be located under ```bin/MoggeFluid```.
